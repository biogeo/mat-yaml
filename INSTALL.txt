To install Mat-YAML, you'll need to do the following:


Linux / Mac OS:
1. Download and install libyaml (available from http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML).
2. Build the yaml_mex mex file for your platform. If libyaml installed nicely
   and you already have MEX configured properly for your system (see the Matlab
   documentation for that), then you should just need to change to the mex-src
   directory and enter the following command at the Matlab prompt:

   >>> mex yaml_mex.c yaml_mex_util.c -lyaml

   If you are on a 64-bit Mac OS system, this may fail, because libyaml builds
   as 32-bit by default, and Matlab can't link to that code for a 64-bit MEX
   file. If this happens, try the following commands instead of "make" during
   the libyaml installation process:

   % make CFLAGS='-g -O2 -arch x86_64'
   % cp src/.libs/libyaml.a <path/to/mat-yaml>/mex-src/libyaml64.a

   And then in Matlab:

   >>> mex yaml_mex.c yaml_mex_util.c libyaml64.a

3. Add mat-yaml/mex-src and mat-yaml/mfiles to your Matlab path, or copy the
   files in them to a directory already on your path.


Windows:
    I'm afraid I haven't got the slightest idea how to build this on Windows. If
    someone manages to do so and would like to submit instructions, I'll gladly
    add them here.
